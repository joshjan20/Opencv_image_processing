Here's a `README.md` file that explains your code, how to run it, and what it does. This will be useful to document your project on GitHub or any other platform.

# Image Processing with OpenCV

This project demonstrates basic image manipulation using the OpenCV library in Python. The script performs various operations such as resizing, rotating, and pixel manipulation on an image.

## Features

1. **Resizing Image**: 
    - The image is resized to 50% of its original size.
    
2. **Rotating Image**:
    - The image is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
    
3. **Pixel Manipulation**:
    - The first 100 rows of the image are modified to display random pixel values.
    
4. **Copy and Paste Region**:
    - A portion of the image is copied from one area and pasted into another.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

You can install OpenCV using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Place your image file (e.g., `asset1.png`) in an `assets/` directory inside the project.
3. Run the script with Python:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Code Breakdown

### Image Resizing and Rotation

```python
import cv2

img = cv2.imread('assets/asset1.png', 1)
img = cv2.resize(img, (0, 0), fx=0.5, fy=0.5)
img = cv2.rotate(img, cv2.ROTATE_90_CLOCKWISE)
cv2.imwrite('new_img.jpg', img)

cv2.imshow('Image', img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

- **Resizing**: The image is resized to 50% of its original dimensions using `cv2.resize()`.
- **Rotating**: The image is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise using `cv2.rotate()`.

### Pixel Manipulation

In the second part of the code, we modify some pixels in the image:

```python
import random

def update_pixel(image_path):
    img = cv2.imread(image_path, -1)
    print(img.shape)

    # Change first 100 rows to random pixels
    for i in range(100):
        for j in range(img.shape[1]):
            img[i][j] = [random.randint(0, 255), random.randint(0, 255), random.randint(0, 255), random.randint(0, 255)]

    # Copy part of image
    tag = img[150:200, 90:130]
    img[50:100, 40:80] = tag

    cv2.imshow('Image', img)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Provide the path to the image file here
    image_path = 'assets/asset1.png'
    update_pixel(image_path)
```

- **Random Pixel Assignment**: The first 100 rows of pixels in the image are assigned random color values.
- **Copy and Paste Region**: A portion of the image from rows `150:200` and columns `90:130` is copied and pasted into another region (`50:100, 40:80`).

## Example Output

- The output image is saved as `new_img.jpg` in the same directory.
- The manipulated image will also be displayed in a window.
